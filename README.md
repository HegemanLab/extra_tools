# extra_tools
A collection of extra scripts and tools developed for one-off use. Some written in Python, some in R. 

## A note about the generic_PCA.R script
The generic PCA script also contains methods for conducting PLS-DA analysis. There are some high level parameters available to fine tune the methods to your work, however for more specific parameter adjustments you will need to go in and edit the code. Additionally, the S-Plot feature in that script still remains relatively untested and the results may not be as desired. If you plan to use the S-Plot feature of the script, insure that you are confident in the underlying statistics and it would be advisable to step line-by-line through the code to make sure the results are as intended.
